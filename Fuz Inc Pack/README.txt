This resource pack is intended to add textures to items that are named or have lore.
Of the textures added, there are three different groups:


1. The first is old/removed minecraft textures.
These will be added to named items, as well as certain alpha blocks that are untextured.
Textures from Mojang's other Minecraft related games (Story Mode and Dungeons) will be added as well.


2. The second is untextured MCO collectables like event items, named items, or admin items.
Many player-made items lack textures, so some of the more significant items will be textured.
Certain event items are lacking textures (and possibly might not get textured) so this pack will add textures until they are updated in the official pack.


3. The third is miscellaneous textures that I think would be cool to have.
This could include custom music discs and more video game references.


Each group will get a distinct folder for their respective textures.
The folder "oldmc" will hold removed, unsued, or older textures.
The folder "altmc" will hold textures from other Minecraft games or versions.
The folder "collectables" will hold textures for MCO collectables.
The folder "other" holds all other textures.
